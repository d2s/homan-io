Back in the days of xanga, myspace, and geocities, the internet was a different place. It was perfectly ok to browse your friends websites that included gifs of the hamster dance, marquee tags and what have you.

Today though, even though there has been a bit of a movement to bring back the attitude of the internet being a playground, there is no big social media sites where one can truly fsck their site up.

This is my own attempt to remedy that for myself.
