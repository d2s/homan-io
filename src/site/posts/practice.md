## Practice and Learning

I used to be a bad employee, I'm still not a perfect employee by any means, but I used to be afraid to write code and when I wrote code it was never good code.

My code is still far from perfect, but now I'm not nearly as afraid to code, even if I end up throwing away the project or not showing it to anyone...

I think that's a big problem. In the 90s, between xanga, myspace, and geocities, it was perfectly ok to browse your friends profiles that included gifs of the hamster dance, marque tags and what have you.

Today though, while there has been a big of a movement to bring back the atitude of the internet being a playground, there is no big social media sites where one can truly fsck their profile up.
