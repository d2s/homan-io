## Purpose

I wanted to write about the purpose of this site and it made me wonder further about the purpose of everything.

Sometimes (recently for me at me) I question why I'm doing what I'm doing, or try to find some reason to keep going. And over the years these are the "jist" of what I believe... hopefully by explaining it, it also helps me reorient myself.

The Dalai Lama in the "The Art of Happiness" makes the case that he believe that he thinks the purpose of life is to be happy. I agree with him, some people find happiness through their kids, jobs, friends, and for some it's drugs. The problem with some of these sources of happiness is that you take away the kids, jobs, friends or drugs and suddenly you find yourself in a bad spot.

I don't think that makes them invalid by any means, but I think it's important to diversify your sources of happiness, that way if you were to suddenly find yourself without your significant other, job, what have you that you'd still have other things for you to find happiness.

I used to think that the purpose of life was to find a purpose. I still think there is some true to that, the actual task or job that you do isn't the source of joy or pride. No, it's the feeling of appreciation that others give you for doing it.
